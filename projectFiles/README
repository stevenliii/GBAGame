Welcome to the World's Easiest Game!

In this game, your objective is to make it from the starting point to the green goal zone without being hit by the red obstacle. You have three lives; every time you touch the red obstacle, you lose a life. If you run out of lives, you lose the game.

To begin the game, press the Enter key to start.

Use the arrow keys to navigate across the screen. Your lives are displayed on the top left of the screen.

If at any point you would like to restart, simply press the Delete key.

Have fun!
